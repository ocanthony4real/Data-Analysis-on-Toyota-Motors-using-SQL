# SQL_Project_1
This is a data anlaysis carried out on the financial statements of Toyota Motors as pulled from Yahoo Finance (on 4/8/2022). The data was extracted using python and then manipulated into proper tables. You can find the python script among the files in this repository.

Thereafter, some data manipulation and explorative analysis were carried out using SQL. You can also find the script in this repository. During the analysis, I drew invaluable insights from the data, including the perfomance of the company in the given period and the implication of such performances.
