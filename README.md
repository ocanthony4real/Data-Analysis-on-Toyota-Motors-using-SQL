# SQL_Project_1
This is an anlaysis carried out on the financial statements of Toyota Motors as pulled from Yahoo Finance (on 4/8/2022). The data was extracted using python and then manipulated into proper tables. You can find the python script among the files in this repository (labelled 'Pyrhon_Script_(Data_extraction).ipynb').

Thereafter, some data manipulation and explorative analysis were carried out using SQL. You can also find the script in this repository. During the analysis, I drew invaluable insights from the data, including the perfomance of the company in the given period and the implication of such performances.
